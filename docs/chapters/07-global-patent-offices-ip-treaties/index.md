## Introduction

Intellectual property protection is inherently territorial -- a patent granted in one country confers no rights in another. Yet innovation is global, supply chains span continents, and competitors operate across jurisdictions. For IP professionals, this means that understanding the procedures, standards, and strategic considerations at the world's major patent offices is not optional; it is a core competency. This chapter moves beyond the USPTO-centric view of earlier chapters and examines the international landscape in which patent prosecution actually occurs.

We begin with the European Patent Office (EPO), the second-largest patent authority by application volume, before turning to the Japan Patent Office (JPO), the China National Intellectual Property Administration (CNIPA), and the Korean Intellectual Property Office (KIPO). Together with the USPTO, these five offices form the "IP5" -- the consortium responsible for roughly 85% of all patent filings worldwide. The chapter then broadens to the treaty-level architecture: the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO), the TRIPs Agreement, and ongoing patent harmonization efforts. Finally, we survey the regional patent systems -- including the African IP Organization and the Eurasian Patent System -- that extend patent protection across groups of countries through a single filing.

## 7.1 The European Patent Office (EPO)

### 7.1.1 EPO Filing

The European Patent Office provides a centralized filing and examination procedure that can result in patent protection across up to 44 member states of the European Patent Convention (EPC), plus several "extension" and "validation" states. Rather than filing separate national applications in each European country, an applicant files a single European patent application -- either directly at the EPO or through the PCT route designating the EPO as a regional office during national phase entry.

A European patent application must include the following components:

- **Request for grant** -- filed on EPO Form 1001, identifying the applicant, the inventor, the title of the invention, and the contracting states designated for protection
- **Description** -- a full disclosure of the invention, meeting the sufficiency requirement under Article 83 EPC
- **Claims** -- defining the subject matter for which protection is sought, with an independent claim and any dependent claims
- **Abstract** -- a concise technical summary for search purposes
- **Drawings** -- if necessary to understand the invention
- **Priority documents** -- if claiming priority under the Paris Convention, priority must be claimed within 12 months of the earliest filing

The filing may be made in any of the three official EPO languages -- English, French, or German. If filed in another language, a translation into one official language must be submitted within two months. The filing date is accorded once the EPO receives a reference to a previously filed application or a description (even in a non-official language) along with information identifying the applicant and contact details.

| Filing Requirement | EPO | USPTO (for comparison) |
|---|---|---|
| Official languages | English, French, German | English |
| Filing fee (2025 schedule) | EUR 135 (online) / EUR 270 (paper) | USD 320 (large entity, electronic) |
| Designation fee | EUR 660 (covers all states) | N/A (single jurisdiction) |
| Search fee | EUR 1,490 | USD 700 (large entity) |
| Claims surcharge | >15 claims: EUR 275 each | >3 independent or >20 total |
| Priority period | 12 months (Paris Convention) | 12 months (Paris Convention) |
| Filing routes | Direct or PCT national phase | Direct, PCT, or bypass continuation |

After filing, the EPO conducts a formalities examination to verify that the application satisfies the requirements for according a filing date and that all formal requirements are met. The application is then forwarded to the search division.

### 7.1.2 EPO Examination

The EPO examination process is structured in two mandatory phases -- search and substantive examination -- separated by a decision point where the applicant must affirmatively request examination.

**Search phase.** The EPO search division prepares a European Search Report (ESR) accompanied by a preliminary, non-binding opinion on patentability. The ESR cites prior art documents categorized by relevance (X = particularly relevant alone, Y = particularly relevant in combination, A = background, D = cited in the application, etc.). The search report and opinion are published together with the application 18 months after the priority date.

**Request for examination.** Within six months of the publication of the ESR, the applicant must file a request for substantive examination and pay the examination fee (EUR 1,885 as of 2025). Failure to do so results in the application being deemed withdrawn.

**Substantive examination.** A three-member examining division assesses the application against the requirements of the EPC: novelty (Article 54), inventive step (Article 56), industrial applicability (Article 57), sufficiency of disclosure (Article 83), and clarity of claims (Article 84). The examining division issues written communications (analogous to USPTO office actions) identifying objections, and the applicant may amend claims and argue in response. Oral proceedings before the examining division may be requested by either side and serve a function similar to an examiner interview at the USPTO, though they are more formal and often dispositive.

#### Diagram: EPO Prosecution Flowchart

> **Specification:** A vertical flowchart showing the stages of EPO prosecution from filing to grant or refusal. Nodes should include: (1) Filing and formalities check, (2) Search by Search Division producing ESR + Opinion, (3) Publication at 18 months, (4) Decision point -- Request for Examination (6-month window), (5) Substantive Examination by Examining Division, (6) Communication/Response cycle (loop), (7) Oral Proceedings (optional branch), (8) Decision to Grant or Refuse, (9) If granted -- Opposition period (9 months), (10) Validation in designated states. A branch from Refuse should lead to Appeal (Boards of Appeal). Color-code phases: blue for search, green for examination, red for opposition/appeal.

If the application meets all requirements, the examining division issues a communication under Rule 71(3) EPC indicating its intention to grant. The applicant must then approve the text, pay the grant and printing fees, and file translations of the claims into the two EPO official languages not used as the language of proceedings. Upon grant, the European patent must be "validated" in each designated contracting state where protection is desired, which typically requires filing translations and paying national fees within prescribed deadlines (usually three months from grant publication). This validation step is a critical distinction from the USPTO, where a single grant automatically provides nationwide protection.

**Opposition.** Any third party may file an opposition within nine months of the publication of the grant, challenging the patent on grounds such as lack of novelty, lack of inventive step, or insufficiency of disclosure. Opposition proceedings are heard by a three-member opposition division and can result in maintenance, amendment, or revocation of the patent.

## 7.2 The Japan Patent Office (JPO)

The Japan Patent Office, a division of the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI), is one of the world's most technologically sophisticated patent offices. Japan consistently ranks among the top three countries by filing volume, with strengths concentrated in electronics, automotive, precision manufacturing, and materials science.

Key features of JPO practice that distinguish it from the USPTO and EPO include the following:

- **Request for examination requirement** -- Like the EPO, the JPO does not automatically examine applications upon filing. The applicant (or any third party) must file a request for examination within three years of the filing date. Roughly 70% of filed applications proceed to examination.
- **Accelerated examination** -- The JPO offers several acceleration tracks, including the Patent Prosecution Highway (PPH), the Super Accelerated Examination program (results in a first action within approximately one month), and the PACE program for green technology.
- **Unity of invention** -- The JPO applies a strict unity of invention standard rather than the USPTO's restriction/election practice. If lack of unity is found, the applicant must typically file divisional applications for non-elected inventions.
- **Amendment practice** -- Amendments at the JPO must be supported by the originally filed description, claims, or drawings. The JPO applies a "new matter" prohibition similar in concept to the USPTO's written description requirement but interpreted through Japanese case law.
- **Language** -- Applications must be filed in Japanese. Foreign applicants entering via the PCT may file in English initially but must provide a Japanese translation within a prescribed period.

| Feature | JPO | USPTO |
|---|---|---|
| Examination request deadline | 3 years from filing | Automatic upon filing |
| First action pendency (average) | ~10 months | ~16 months |
| Grant rate | ~75% | ~70% |
| Official language | Japanese | English |
| Opposition timing | Post-grant (6 months) | N/A (inter partes review instead) |
| Patent term | 20 years from filing | 20 years from filing |

The JPO has been a leader in digital transformation, offering the J-PlatPat database for free public access to Japanese patent documents, utility models, designs, and trademarks. The office has also invested heavily in AI-assisted prior art searching and machine translation, recognizing that language barriers are one of the most significant challenges in cross-border patent prosecution.

## 7.3 China National Intellectual Property Administration (CNIPA)

The China National Intellectual Property Administration -- renamed from SIPO (State Intellectual Property Office) in 2018 -- is now the world's largest patent office by annual filing volume, having surpassed the USPTO in total filings in 2011. China received over 1.5 million invention patent applications in 2024 alone, reflecting the country's massive investment in innovation and its government policies encouraging domestic patent filing.

CNIPA administers three types of patents: invention patents (comparable to utility patents in the U.S.), utility model patents (which require novelty but not inventive step and receive no substantive examination), and design patents. For invention patents, the prosecution process broadly mirrors the EPO model: applications are published at 18 months, and substantive examination must be requested within three years of filing. The examination evaluates novelty, inventive step (called "creativeness" in Chinese patent law), and practical applicability.

Practitioners should be aware of several distinctive features of CNIPA practice:

- **Utility models** -- These are granted after formalities examination only (no substantive search or examination), typically within 6-12 months. They provide 10 years of protection and are widely used for incremental innovations, particularly by domestic Chinese applicants.
- **Simultaneous filings** -- Chinese law permits filing both an invention patent and a utility model patent for the same invention simultaneously, providing early utility model protection while awaiting the longer invention patent examination.
- **Patent Examination Guidelines** -- The CNIPA Patent Examination Guidelines are revised frequently and serve as the primary reference for prosecution practice. They contain detailed rules on subject matter eligibility, including specific provisions for software, business methods, and traditional Chinese medicine.
- **Invalidation proceedings** -- Post-grant challenges at CNIPA are handled through an invalidation procedure before the Patent Reexamination and Invalidation Department (formerly the Patent Reexamination Board). Decisions can be appealed to the Beijing Intellectual Property Court.

Language remains a significant barrier; all filings and prosecution must be conducted in Chinese. Foreign applicants must use a locally licensed patent agent, and translations must be carefully prepared because the Chinese text controls in any dispute.

## 7.4 Korean Intellectual Property Office (KIPO)

The Korean Intellectual Property Office, headquartered in Daejeon, is the fifth member of the IP5 consortium. South Korea punches well above its weight in patent filing -- its per capita patent filing rate is among the highest in the world, driven by the R&D intensity of Korean industry conglomerates (chaebols) such as Samsung, LG, Hyundai, and SK.

KIPO's examination system shares the request-for-examination model used by the JPO and EPO, with a three-year window from filing. KIPO has invested aggressively in reducing pendency, and average first-action pendency is approximately 10 months. Like the JPO, KIPO participates in the Patent Prosecution Highway (PPH), allowing applicants to leverage favorable results from one office to accelerate examination at the other.

Notable aspects of Korean patent practice include a robust utility model system (similar to China's), a well-developed design patent system, and an active IP Trial and Appeal Board (IPTAB) for post-grant disputes. KIPO has also been a pioneer among IP5 offices in deploying AI for patent classification and prior art searching, and the office offers an English-language filing option for PCT national phase entries, with a Korean translation required within a set period.

## 7.5 The IP5 Offices

The IP5 is a cooperative framework comprising the five largest intellectual property offices in the world: the USPTO, EPO, JPO, CNIPA, and KIPO. Established in 2007, the IP5 framework is designed to improve the efficiency and quality of patent examination globally through work-sharing, data exchange, and procedural harmonization.

| IP5 Office | Location | Annual Patent Filings (approx. 2024) | Official Language(s) | Examination Model |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| USPTO | Alexandria, VA, USA | ~620,000 | English | Automatic upon filing |
| EPO | Munich, Germany | ~200,000 | English, French, German | Request within 6 months of ESR |
| JPO | Tokyo, Japan | ~290,000 | Japanese | Request within 3 years |
| CNIPA | Beijing, China | ~1,500,000 | Chinese | Request within 3 years |
| KIPO | Daejeon, South Korea | ~240,000 | Korean | Request within 3 years |

The IP5 offices collectively account for approximately 85% of all patent applications filed worldwide and roughly 95% of all Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT) work. Their collaborative initiatives include:

- **Common Citation Document (CCD)** -- A shared database allowing any examiner at an IP5 office to view prior art cited by examiners at the other four offices, reducing duplicative searching and improving consistency.
- **Global Dossier** -- A platform providing access to the prosecution file histories of related applications across the IP5 offices, enabling applicants and examiners alike to track the status of patent families worldwide.
- **Patent Prosecution Highway (PPH)** -- A bilateral and multilateral network of agreements allowing applicants whose claims have been found allowable at one office to request accelerated examination at another. The PPH significantly reduces pendency and examination costs for multinational filings.
- **IP5 AI Task Force** -- A joint initiative exploring the use of artificial intelligence and machine learning in patent classification, prior art searching, and machine translation across the five offices.

#### Chart: Comparative Patent Filing Volumes Across IP5 Offices (2015-2024)

> **Specification:** A grouped bar chart with the X-axis showing years from 2015 to 2024 (annual intervals) and the Y-axis showing total invention patent filings in thousands. Each year should have five grouped bars, one per IP5 office, each in a distinct color (e.g., USPTO = blue, EPO = dark red, JPO = green, CNIPA = orange, KIPO = purple). The chart should clearly show CNIPA's dramatic growth trajectory relative to the other four offices, the relative stability of JPO filings, and the modest growth at the USPTO and EPO. Include a legend and Y-axis label.

Understanding the IP5 ecosystem is essential for any IP professional managing a global patent portfolio. The work-sharing tools, harmonized practices, and cooperative databases created by the IP5 directly impact prosecution strategy, including decisions about where to file first, how to leverage favorable office actions in one jurisdiction to accelerate examination in others, and how to coordinate claim scope across a patent family.

## 7.6 World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO)

The World Intellectual Property Organization is a specialized agency of the United Nations, headquartered in Geneva, Switzerland. Founded in 1967 and operational from 1970, WIPO serves as the global forum for intellectual property policy, services, and cooperation. Unlike the patent offices discussed above, WIPO does not itself grant patents; rather, it administers international filing systems and treaties that facilitate IP protection across its 193 member states.

WIPO's most significant operational roles include:

- **PCT System** -- WIPO administers the Patent Cooperation Treaty, which provides a unified international patent filing procedure used by applicants from nearly every country in the world. As discussed in Chapter 6, the PCT does not result in an "international patent" but streamlines the process of seeking protection in multiple countries.
- **Madrid System** -- WIPO operates the Madrid Protocol for the international registration of trademarks, allowing a single application to designate protection in over 130 countries.
- **Hague System** -- The Hague Agreement provides an international registration system for industrial designs.
- **Arbitration and Mediation Center** -- WIPO operates a dispute resolution center that handles, among other things, domain name disputes under the Uniform Domain-Name Dispute-Resolution Policy (UDRP).

Beyond these operational services, WIPO plays a critical normative role. It administers 26 international treaties related to intellectual property, convenes diplomatic conferences to negotiate new treaties, and produces influential reports and statistics on global innovation trends. WIPO's annual *World Intellectual Property Indicators* report is a primary data source for understanding global filing trends, and its Technology Trends publications provide strategic intelligence on emerging technology areas.

WIPO also provides technical assistance and capacity building for developing countries, helping them build the institutional infrastructure necessary to administer and enforce IP rights. This development mission sometimes creates tension with WIPO's other role as an advocate for strong IP protection, a dynamic that plays out in treaty negotiations and policy debates.

## 7.7 The TRIPs Agreement

The Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPs), administered by the World Trade Organization (WTO), is the most comprehensive multilateral agreement on intellectual property. Negotiated during the Uruguay Round (1986-1994) and effective from January 1, 1995, TRIPs established minimum standards of IP protection that all WTO members must incorporate into their domestic law.

TRIPs is significant for several reasons. First, it linked intellectual property to the international trade regime for the first time, meaning that failures to comply with TRIPs obligations can be challenged through the WTO's dispute settlement mechanism and can result in trade sanctions. Second, it established substantive minimums across all major categories of intellectual property: patents, trademarks, copyrights, geographical indications, industrial designs, integrated circuit topographies, and trade secrets (referred to as "undisclosed information"). Third, it required member states to provide effective enforcement mechanisms, including civil judicial procedures, provisional measures, border measures, and criminal penalties for willful counterfeiting and piracy.

Key patent provisions of TRIPs include:

- **Article 27** -- Patents must be available for inventions in all fields of technology, whether products or processes, provided they are new, involve an inventive step, and are capable of industrial application. Limited exceptions are permitted (e.g., for public order, diagnostic methods, and plant varieties).
- **Article 28** -- Patent owners must receive the exclusive right to prevent third parties from making, using, selling, offering for sale, or importing the patented product (or, for process patents, the product obtained by the process).
- **Article 33** -- The patent term must be at least 20 years from the filing date.
- **Article 31** -- Compulsory licensing is permitted under certain conditions, including adequate remuneration to the patent holder, prior effort to obtain a voluntary license, and limitation of scope and duration.
- **Article 39** -- WTO members must protect undisclosed information (trade secrets) against unfair commercial use.

TRIPs includes flexibilities that developing countries have relied upon, particularly in the area of public health. The Doha Declaration on the TRIPs Agreement and Public Health (2001) affirmed that TRIPs "can and should be interpreted and implemented in a manner supportive of WTO Members' right to protect public health," and a subsequent protocol amendment (Article 31bis, effective 2017) allows compulsory licensing for the export of generic pharmaceuticals to countries lacking manufacturing capacity.

## 7.8 Patent Harmonization

Patent harmonization refers to ongoing international efforts to reduce differences in patent law and procedure across jurisdictions, thereby lowering costs and increasing predictability for multinational applicants. Despite the common floor established by TRIPs, significant differences remain in substantive patent law, examination standards, and procedural requirements across even the IP5 offices.

The major areas where harmonization has been pursued -- and the current state of those efforts -- are summarized in the following table:

| Harmonization Area | Current Status | Key Differences That Remain |
|---|---|---|
| First-to-file vs. first-to-invent | Largely harmonized; U.S. adopted first-inventor-to-file in AIA (2013) | Minor differences in grace period scope and prior user rights |
| Grace period | Not harmonized | U.S. has 12-month grace period; EPO and JPO have very limited or no grace period for applicant's own disclosures |
| Prior art definition | Partially harmonized | Differences in geographic scope, oral disclosures, and secret prior use |
| Unity of invention / restriction | Not harmonized | USPTO uses restriction practice; EPO/JPO/CNIPA/KIPO use unity of invention |
| Claim interpretation | Not harmonized | U.S. uses "broadest reasonable interpretation" during prosecution; EPO uses a "purposive" approach; post-grant interpretation also differs |
| Patentable subject matter | Not harmonized | Significant divergence on software, business methods, and biotech |
| Patent term extensions | Not harmonized | Different approaches to regulatory delay compensation (PTA, PTE, SPC) |

Harmonization efforts have been conducted through multiple forums, including WIPO's Standing Committee on the Law of Patents (SCP), the IP5 framework, and bilateral and regional trade agreements. The Substantive Patent Law Treaty (SPLT), a WIPO initiative aimed at harmonizing core patentability requirements, has been under negotiation since the early 2000s but has stalled due to fundamental disagreements between developed and developing countries on issues such as grace periods, prior art, and the role of patent offices versus courts.

In practice, the Patent Prosecution Highway and the IP5 work-sharing programs achieve a form of de facto harmonization by encouraging examiners to consider examination results from other offices. While this falls short of true legal harmonization, it increases consistency in outcomes and reduces the costs associated with prosecuting the same invention in multiple jurisdictions.

## 7.9 Regional Patent Systems

Regional patent systems allow applicants to obtain patent protection in multiple countries through a single application and examination process. These systems are distinct from international filing treaties like the PCT, which provides a unified filing procedure but ultimately requires national or regional phase prosecution. In a true regional system, a single grant can provide enforceable patent rights across all member states of the regional convention.

The major regional patent systems currently in operation are:

- **European Patent Convention (EPC)** -- Administered by the EPO, covering 39 contracting states plus extension and validation states (discussed in Section 7.1)
- **African Regional Intellectual Property Organization (ARIPO)** -- Headquartered in Harare, Zimbabwe, covering 22 predominantly English-speaking African member states under the Harare Protocol
- **Organisation Africaine de la Propriete Intellectuelle (OAPI)** -- Headquartered in Yaounde, Cameroon, covering 17 predominantly French-speaking African states under the Bangui Agreement
- **Eurasian Patent Organization (EAPO)** -- Headquartered in Moscow, covering 8 member states of the former Soviet Union under the Eurasian Patent Convention
- **Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) Patent Office** -- Covering 6 Gulf states, though the system has experienced operational challenges and reduced usage in recent years
- **ASEAN Patent Examination Co-operation (ASPEC)** -- A work-sharing program among the patent offices of 10 Southeast Asian nations (not a true regional patent with a single grant, but a cooperative acceleration mechanism)

### 7.9.1 African IP Organizations

Africa has two regional patent systems -- ARIPO and OAPI -- reflecting the continent's colonial linguistic divisions. Understanding the distinction between them is critical for any filing strategy involving African countries.

**ARIPO (Harare Protocol).** Under ARIPO, an applicant files a single application designating one or more of the member states. The application is examined by ARIPO, and if it meets the requirements, ARIPO communicates its intention to grant to the designated states. Each designated state then has six months to refuse the grant on national grounds; if no refusal is communicated, the patent is deemed granted in that state. Importantly, an ARIPO patent is essentially a bundle of national patents -- validity and enforcement are determined on a country-by-country basis.

**OAPI (Bangui Agreement).** The OAPI system is more deeply integrated. An OAPI patent is a single unitary right that is automatically effective across all 17 OAPI member states. There is no designation of individual states, and member states cannot individually refuse. The patent is examined and granted by OAPI, and once granted, it has the same effect as a national patent in each member state. This unitary character makes OAPI unique among regional systems.

| Feature | ARIPO | OAPI |
|---|---|---|
| Headquarters | Harare, Zimbabwe | Yaounde, Cameroon |
| Member states | 22 (English-speaking) | 17 (French-speaking) |
| Governing agreement | Harare Protocol (1982) | Bangui Agreement (1977, revised 1999) |
| Designation of states | Required (opt-in) | Automatic (all states) |
| National refusal option | Yes (6-month window) | No |
| Patent effect | Bundle of national patents | Single unitary patent |
| Examination | ARIPO examines; some reliance on ISR | OAPI examines; some reliance on ISR |
| Working language | English | French |

### 7.9.2 Eurasian Patent System

The Eurasian Patent Organization (EAPO), established by the Eurasian Patent Convention signed in 1994, provides a regional patent system for states that were formerly part of the Soviet Union. The Eurasian Patent Office (EAPO), based in Moscow, examines applications and grants Eurasian patents that have effect across all member states.

The current member states of the Eurasian Patent Convention are: Russia, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, and Turkmenistan. Notably, Georgia, Moldova, and Ukraine -- also former Soviet states -- are not members, having opted to align more closely with the European patent system.

A Eurasian patent application may be filed directly with the EAPO or through the PCT route. Examination follows a substantive review similar to the EPO model, and granted patents have equal force in all member states without the need for national validation or translation (Russian is the sole official language of the EAPO, and the Russian-language grant is effective throughout the region). Annual maintenance fees are paid centrally to the EAPO but calculated based on the number of designated states in which the patent is maintained.

The Eurasian system offers strategic value for applicants needing protection in the Central Asian and Caucasus markets, particularly in the extractive industries (oil, gas, mining) that dominate many member-state economies. It also provides a cost-effective way to maintain patent rights in Russia alongside its neighboring states.

## 7.10 Strategic Considerations for Global Filing

Selecting the right filing strategy across multiple offices and systems requires balancing legal, commercial, and cost factors. The following considerations are central to global prosecution planning:

1. **Market coverage** -- File in jurisdictions where the applicant sells products, manufactures goods, or faces competition. Patent rights are only valuable if they cover commercially relevant territories.

2. **Cost management** -- Translation fees, local agent fees, and official fees vary dramatically across offices. CNIPA filings require Chinese translation; JPO filings require Japanese. Regional systems (ARIPO, OAPI, EAPO) can consolidate costs when protection is needed in multiple member states.

3. **Timing and acceleration** -- Use the PPH and work-sharing tools to leverage favorable examination results from one office to accelerate prosecution elsewhere. File first in the office most likely to produce a favorable result quickly (often the JPO or KIPO due to shorter pendency), then use that result to support arguments in other offices.

4. **Claim consistency** -- While claim scope may need to vary across jurisdictions to comply with local law and practice, maintaining a coherent claim strategy across a patent family improves portfolio quality and simplifies enforcement.

5. **Enforcement landscape** -- Consider the effectiveness of patent enforcement in each jurisdiction. Strong substantive patent rights are of limited value in countries with weak judicial systems or inadequate enforcement mechanisms.

#### Diagram: Decision Tree for Selecting Global Filing Routes

> **Specification:** A decision tree diagram beginning with a root node labeled "Invention Disclosure." The first decision branch asks "Protection needed in how many jurisdictions?" with branches for "1-2 countries" (leading to "Direct national filing"), "3-5 countries in one region" (leading to a choice between "Regional system (EPO, ARIPO, OAPI, EAPO)" and "Individual national filings"), and "5+ countries across regions" (leading to "PCT filing"). From the PCT filing node, branches show the national/regional phase entry options: EPO, JPO, CNIPA, KIPO, USPTO, ARIPO, OAPI, EAPO, and other national offices. Each terminal node should list key considerations (cost, language, pendency).

## Key Takeaways

1. **The EPO offers centralized European protection but requires national validation.** Filing and examination occur at a single office, but the granted European patent must be validated in each designated country, involving translations and national fees. The forthcoming Unitary Patent and Unified Patent Court aim to simplify this process.

2. **The IP5 offices handle 85% of global patent filings.** The USPTO, EPO, JPO, CNIPA, and KIPO cooperate through shared databases (Common Citation Document, Global Dossier) and the Patent Prosecution Highway to improve efficiency and consistency.

3. **CNIPA is the world's largest patent office by volume.** China's patent system includes utility models (no substantive examination) and invention patents (examined). All prosecution is conducted in Chinese, and foreign applicants must use local agents.

4. **WIPO administers the global treaty infrastructure.** Through the PCT, Madrid, and Hague systems, WIPO provides the procedural framework for international IP filings, while also serving as the forum for policy development and treaty negotiation.

5. **TRIPs establishes binding minimum standards.** The WTO-administered TRIPs Agreement requires all member states to provide patent protection for at least 20 years, covering all fields of technology, with enforcement mechanisms backed by trade sanctions.

6. **Patent harmonization remains incomplete.** Despite significant progress (e.g., the global shift to first-to-file), important differences persist in grace periods, claim interpretation, subject matter eligibility, and examination practice.

7. **Regional patent systems reduce filing costs for multi-country protection.** The EPO, ARIPO, OAPI, and EAPO each allow a single filing to cover multiple countries, though the legal effect of the resulting patent varies (bundle of national rights vs. unitary right).

8. **Strategic global filing requires balancing coverage, cost, and timing.** Effective use of the PCT, PPH, and regional systems allows practitioners to obtain broad geographic protection while managing translation costs, agent fees, and prosecution timelines.
