- **GitHub Actions** — Automated deployment to GitHub Pages
- **Python** — Graph analysis and validation scripts

## Methodology

This textbook was generated using a structured pipeline:

1. Course description with Bloom's Taxonomy learning outcomes
2. 200-concept learning graph with dependency mapping
3. Chapter structure respecting concept prerequisites
4. Content generation at professional reading level
5. Automated deployment via GitHub Actions

Part of an ongoing exploration applying knowledge graph methodology across diverse domains — from industrial IoT to legal technology to medical education — to test whether the approach is truly domain-agnostic.
